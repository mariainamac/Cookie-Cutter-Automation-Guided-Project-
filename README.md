# Cookie-Cutter-Automation-Guided-Project-

This is a guided project from Youtube by Tech with Tim - Python Selenium Tutorial - Automate Websites and Create Bots

Things used: 
- Pycharm
- Selenium
- Chrome webdriver

This is a web automation and creating bots to automatically do things for you. In this instance, this is a project whereby, we had done a web automation to go to Orteil's cookie clicker website and automatically select the english language and then click the cookie in a continuous loop. We also made the bot automatically purchase a clicker from the store when the amount meets the right price in the store. 

The reason behind why I want to learn project related to automation and Selenium is to have a hands on experience on how to automate websites, most especially using Selenium and Python to do Test Automation which is my future career prospect (manual tester at the moment). In the future, I hope to learn more and be more knowledgable to upskill into Test Automatation role.
